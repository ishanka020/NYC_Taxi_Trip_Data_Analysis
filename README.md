# NYC_Taxi_Trip_Data_Analysis

The vast amount of taxi trip data in New York City contains millions of entries that can’t be handled by traditional tools. But there is a lot of knowledge hidden within this mountain of information.

There are two challenges: 

    1. Data Overload – The huge size and disorder of the dataset make it difficult to analyze without a distributed system.
    2. Unexplored Questions – Questions like “When are tips most generous?”, “What’s the busiest pickup zone?”, or “Which routes are the most common?” are not easily answered without the right tools and techniques.

So, the problem we’re trying to solve is:

    How can we use distributed data processing to extract meaningful, real-world data from massive NYC taxi trip data?


## Project Objective
  
    The objective of this project is to extract meaningful information from the New York City Taxi Trip dataset using Apache Spark, a powerful framework for processing big data. Our team focuses on analyzing large-  scale trip data to understand taxi usage patterns, fare behavior, trip routes, and more.

### Aims
    
    To clean and process large real-world datasets efficiently using Spark
    To explore time-based and location-based taxi trends across NYC
    To build a simple predictive model to estimate tips
    To visualize findings to support urban mobility and transportation conclusions
This project demonstrates how big data tools, such as Spark, can help make sense of urban transportation behavior, supporting city planners, taxi operators, and researchers in informed decision-making.
